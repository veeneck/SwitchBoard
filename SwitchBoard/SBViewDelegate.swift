/**
 Each scene must be aware of how to finish and start the next scene. Instead of extending the view controller and continusouly accessing that, we can create a class that implements this protocol. In this project, SBSceneManager implements this protocol, and each scene contains a reference to the scene manager. Then, each scene can just access the scene manager for informaiton on scenes, and also trigger a new scene to begin without worrying about the view.
